        I installed Batocera on a USB using Raspberry Pi Imager.
        I plugged the USB into my laptop's USB port.
        Then I booted my PC and changed the BIOS boot order to boot from the USB.
        When Batocera attempts to boot, I see a resizing screen with a progess bar.
        Then I see another screen with an intro video.
        After that it goes blank.
        I have no video or sound, just a blank screen.
