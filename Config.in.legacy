# Config.in.legacy - support for backward compatibility
#
# When an existing Config.in symbol is removed, it should be added again in
# this file, and take appropriate action to approximate backward compatibility.
# This will make the transition for the user more convenient.
#
# When adding legacy symbols to this file, add them to the front. The oldest
# symbols will be removed again after about two years.
#
# The symbol should be copied as-is from the place where it was previously
# defined, but the help text should be removed or replaced with something that
# explains how to fix it.
#
# For bool options, the old symbol should select BR2_LEGACY, so that the user
# is informed at build-time about selected legacy options.
# If there is an equivalent (set of) new symbols, these should be select'ed by
# the old symbol for backwards compatibility.
# It is not possible to select an option that is part of a choice. In that
# case, the new option should use the old symbol as default. This requires a
# change outside of Config.in.legacy, and this should be clearly marked as such
# in a comment, so that removal of legacy options also include the removal of
# these external references.
#
# [Example: renaming a bool option that is part of a choice from FOO to BAR]
# original choice:
# 	choice
# 		prompt "Choose foobar"
# 	config BR2_FOO_1
#		bool "foobar 1"
# 	config BR2_FOO_2
# 		bool "foobar 2"
# 	endchoice
#
# becomes:
#   choice
#   	prompt "Choose foobar"
#   	default BR2_BAR_1 if BR2_FOO_1 # legacy
#   	default BR2_BAR_2 if BR2_FOO_2 # legacy
#   config BR2_BAR_1
#		bool "foobar 1"
#   config BR2_BAR_2
#   	bool "foobar 2"
#   endchoice
#
# and in Config.in.legacy:
#   config BR2_FOO_1
#   	bool "foobar 1 has been renamed"
#   	help
#   	  <suitable help text>
#   # Note: BR2_FOO_1 is still referenced from package/foo/Config.in
#   config BR2_FOO_2
#   	bool "foobar 2 has been renamed"
#   	help
#   	  <suitable help text>
#   # Note: BR2_FOO_2 is still referenced from package/foo/Config.in
#
# [End of example]
#
# For string options, it is not possible to directly select another symbol. In
# this case, a hidden wrap bool option has to be added, that defaults to y if
# the old string is not set at its default value. The wrap symbol should select
# BR2_LEGACY.
# If the original symbol has been renamed, the new symbol should use the value
# of the old symbol as default. Like for choice options, a comment should be
# added to flag that the symbol is still used in another file.
#
# [Example: renaming a string option from FOO to BAR]
# original symbol:
#   config BR2_FOO_STRING
#   	string "Some foo string"
#
# becomes:
#   config BR2_BAR_STRING
#   	string "Some bar string"
#   	default BR2_FOO_STRING if BR2_FOO_STRING != ""  # legacy
#
# and in Config.in.legacy:
#   config BR2_FOO_STRING
#   	string "The foo string has been renamed"
#   	help
#   	  <suitable help text>
#
#   config BR2_FOO_STRING_WRAP
#   	bool
#   	default y if BR2_FOO_STRING != ""
#   	select BR2_LEGACY
#
#   # Note: BR2_FOO_STRING is still referenced from package/foo/Config.in

config BR2_PACKAGE_QT_JAVASCRIPTCORE

	select BR2_LEGACY

	  The BR2_PACKAGE_QT_JAVASCRIPTCORE option was available to
	  force the activation or disabling of the JIT compiler in the
	  Qt Javascript interpreter. However, the JIT compiler is not
	  available for all architectures, so forcing its activation
	  does not always work. Moreover, Qt knows by itself for which
	  architectures JIT support is possible, and will
	  automatically enable it if possible.

	  Therefore, this option was in fact useless, and causing
	  build problems when enabled on architectures for which the
	  JIT support was not available. It has been removed, and
	  there is no replacement: Qt will enable JIT at compile time
	  when possible.
