## Directory navigation

 - `board` Platform-specific build configuration. This is where to include special patches/configuration files needed to have particular components work on a particular platform. It is instead encouraged to apply patches at the location of the package itself, but this may not always be possible.
 - `buildroot` Buildroot, the tool used to create the final compiled images. For newcomers, you can safely ignore this folder. Compilation instructions can be found [on the wiki](https://wiki.batocera.org/compile_batocera.linux).
 - `configs` Build flags, which define what components will be built with your image depending on your chose architecture. If you're trying to port Batocera to a new architecture (device, platform, new bit mode, etc.) this is the file you'll need to edit. More information on [the build configuration section on the buildroot compiling page](https://wiki.batocera.org/batocera.linux_buildroot_modifications#define_your_configuration).
 - `package` The "meat and potatoes" of Batocera. This is where the majority of emulator data, config generators, core packages, system utilities, etc. all go into. This is the friendliest place to start dev-work for new devs, as most of it is handled by Python and Makefile.
 - `scripts` Various miscellanous scripts that handle aspects external to Batocera, such as the report data sent to the [compatibility page](https://batocera.org/compatibility.php) or info about the Bezel Project.

A cheatsheet of notable files/folders can be found [on the wiki](https://wiki.batocera.org/notable_files).
