# 2026/xx/xx - batocera.linux 43 - Glasswing
### Special Notes
- x86_64 Handhelds with AMD and Intel graphics will be supported on the preferred x86-64-v3 image using Wayland and the LabWC compositor.
  Desktop devices should continue to use the x86-64 image with Xorg.
  Note: Nvidia drivers are currently not included in the x86-64-v3 image.
- The ability to use a custom.sh script is deprecated in this version. If you already used such a script, then it will be one time transformed into a service.
  Please use the services for future scripts and refer to our [Wikipedia](https://wiki.batocera.org/scripting_services_rules_examples)
- TheXTech update in v43 needs minimum of 1.3.7 assets, ensure you update accordingly.
- Azahar Plus has been replaced with the source project Azahar.
  3DS roms will need to be decrypted.
- WINE: Compressed applications (wsquashfs, wtgz) use the same storage paths to store the PREFIX as uncompressed ones.
  `~/wine-bottles/windows/<gamename>` turns to `~/wine-bottles/windows/<winerunner>/<gamename>.wine`
  We recommend following the procedure described in our wiki to back up Windows savegames.
- We have moved to the mainline Nintendo controller driver. You may need to reconfigure your Nintendo controller accordingly for wired & bluetooth.
- Legacy Nvidia 340.xx & 390.xx drivers have been removed from the image going forward.
  These version continue to have problems with later kernel versions and are not longer sustainable.
  Only the legacy 470.xx, 580.xx and current 590.xx drivers will be supported in v43.

- PS4 and PSVita games not appearing in the "last played" auto collection
### Changed / Improved
- Wifi country can now be chosen under the Network Setting option.
  This improves Wifi connectivity by aligning your device with regional regulations as well as 6GHz band support.
- Moonlight has transitioned from Moonlight Embedded to Moonlight QT for the majority of boards to allow for more hardware acceleration.
  Hardware acceleration depends on supported codecs for devices in FFmpeg.
- You can now choose to create a Win32 WINE bottle only via the option to run 32-bit Windows games.
- DOSBox Staging's working directory is now set to the games' folder, allowing for local and relative (img)mount and conf file references.
- DOSBox Staging will fallback to a C:\> prompt inside the games' folder if its missing dosbox.cfg/.conf/.bat files.
- Systems like WINE and DOSBOX can now be prepared from PCManFM context menu. Right click on file items inside supported ones.
  to presetup them. This is mostly thought for startup files like dosbox.bat and autorun.cmd and for handling squashed archive files.

# 2025/10/12 - batocera.linux 42 - Papilio Ulysses
### Special Notes
- Quake 1 & 2 ROMs need moving from tyrquake to quake & vitaquake2 to quake2 folders respectively
  See the _info.txt file for directory layouts & ES file launcher naming conventions.
  vkQuake3 replaces ioquake3 for systems that support Vulkan. saves should continue to work.
  The libretro cores will continue to run as before.
- Removed the buggy libretro-OpenLara in favor of the standalone TR1X Tomb Raider port
  If you have saves, it is recommended to stick with v41 or earlier as the same data is not compatible.
- ZeDMD upgraded. You need firmware ZeDMD 5.1.5. See https://wiki.batocera.org/hardware:diy_zedmd?s[]=dmd#zedmd_configuration
- The folder for Sega CD/Mega CD ROMs is now called `megacd` to keep consistency (like `megadrive` is used, not `genesis`)
- Removed Future Pinball in favor of Visual Pinball which has been available for some time and runs native on Linux
- ScummVM libretro and standalone saves share the same folders now
  If you have saves from the standalone core, it is recommended to move them from `/userdata/saves/scummvm/saves` to `/userdata/saves/scummvm`
- Flycast now names per-game VMU files based on game ID rather than ROM filename. Any per-game VMU files that are based on the
  ROM's filename will be renamed by Flycast when the ROM is launched. This will have the most affect on multi-disc games
  when using the **standalone** emulator because standalone did not remove `(Disc X)` from the ROM name when saving VMUs.
  If you were using per-game saves with standalone, be sure to launch your multi-disc game with the disc you most recently
  played so its VMU is renamed using the game ID.
- Bluetooth Xbox compatible controllers may need to be reconfigured under EmulationStation due to the driver change to `hid-microsoft`

# 2025/01/06 - batocera.linux 41 - Golden-rayed Blue
### Special Notes
- The Xenia Canary introduces GamerTags (user profiles).
  On first run or game launch you may be prompted to create a profile.
  This will sometimes migrate your saves for you.
  If not you can manually copy your saves from your /userdata/saves/xbox360 folder to the new profile folder which is created there.
  Note: The older Xenia version does not have this feature, therefore if you may need to transfer game saves back as necessary.

### Special Notes
- Batocera now has a global battery mode option under Game Settings to determine the power mode when a handheld is unplugged.
  To potentially improve battery consumption, you can adjust the mode the handheld operates at when running on battery.
  By default the power mode will be set to `balanced` mode when unplugged. Other options are `highperformance` or `powersave`
  Note: The `powersave` mode will have the biggest impact on CPU performance whilst gaming to reduce battery consumption as much as possible.
- Singe games now have their own system. Move any Singe related games from `roms/daphne` to the `roms/singe` directory.
  Note: Singe games in the `roms/daphne` folder will no longer work.
  You can determine you have a Singe simulation game when the game folder contains a .singe file.

# 2024/03/04 - batocera.linux 39 - Painted Lady
### Special Notes
- Emulators using Wine now use the Glorious Eggroll custom runner for latest capabilities and compatibility.
  Your previously saved games are still maintained in `/userdata/saves/` in their associated bottle for the afftected emulators Xenia, BigPemu, FPinball & Model2Emu.
  Future WINE bottles are now provisioned here: `/userdata/system/wine-bottles` under their respective system name. Xbox360 emulators (Xenia & Xenai-Canary) have now moved to support VKD3D (D3D12 to Vulkan) for exanded compatibility by default with the previous native Vulkan available as an option.
  New saves will be in `/userdata/saves/xbox360` where you can transfer your previous saves to continue gaming where you left off. You can then free up space by removing your previous WINE bottles from `userdata/saves` respectively after starting each emulator and forming the new WINE bottle accordingly.
  If you have used squashfs for your Windows games you can choose to unsquash & recreate the bottle with the new runner.
- Enhanced Secure Boot support for x86_64 systems requires interaction with the system's Trusted Platform Module (TPM) even when Secure Boot is disabled.
  When booting v39 or later you may need to either disable the TPM or acknowledge the intention to boot Batocera when presented with the blue "Boot Option Restoration" screen.
  See https://wiki.batocera.org/secureboot#tpm for more detailed instructions.
