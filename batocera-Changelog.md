# 2024/03/xx - batocera.linux 39 - Painted Lady
### Special Notes
- Emulators using Wine now use the Glorious Eggroll custom runner for latest capabilities and compatibility.
  Your previously saved games are still maintained in `/userdata/saves/` in their associated bottle for the afftected emulators Xenia, BigPemu, FPinball & Model2Emu.
  Future WINE bottles are now provisioned here: `/userdata/system/wine-bottles` under their respective system name. Xbox360 emulators (Xenia & Xenai-Canary) have now moved to support VKD3D (D3D12 to Vulkan) for exanded compatibility by default with the previous native Vulkan available as an option.
  New saves will be in `/userdata/saves/xbox360` where you can transfer your previous saves to continue gaming where you left off. You can then free up space by removing your previous WINE bottles from `userdata/saves` respectively after starting each emulator and forming the new WINE bottle accordingly.
  If you have used squashfs for your Windows games you can choose to unsquash & recreate the bottle with the new runner.
- Enhanced Secure Boot support for x86_64 systems requires interaction with the system's Trusted Platform Module (TPM) even when Secure Boot is disabled.
  When booting v39 or later you may need to either disable the TPM or acknowledge the intention to boot Batocera when presented with the blue "Boot Option Restoration" screen.
  See https://wiki.batocera.org/secureboot#tpm for more detailed instructions.

- Network shares - advanced configuration
  You've not enough space on your sdcard or on your usbkey ?
  You can now use your nas (like a freebox) as a usbkey (not from the graphical interface for the moment).
  You need to edit the /boot/batocera-boot.conf file like this :
  sharedevice=NETWORK
  sharenetwork_nfs1=ROMS@192.168.0.1:/mnt/Documents/recalbox/roms
  sharenetwork_nfs2=SAVES@192.168.0.1:/mnt/Documents/recalbox/saves
  sharenetwork_nfs3=BIOS@192.168.0.1:/mnt/Documents/recalbox/bios
  sharenetwork_smb1=SHARE@192.168.0.1:Documents/recalbox:guest
