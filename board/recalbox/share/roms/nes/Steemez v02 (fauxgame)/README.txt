Info
----

"Try climbing to the top of this one by throwing streamers and climbing
 them. On your way up you better watch out for the various pie throwing
 clowns, burning candles and bouncing balls, because if they get you,
 you'll die a little each time."

These were the orders given to you, Operative JOE when you were ordered
to infiltrate the evil MASTER Y's floating fortress to destroy the TIGER
ARMY's top secret weapon.
