# uncomment will lead to "safe mode" settings being used to try to boot with maximum HDMI compatibility.

# uncomment this if your display has a black border of unused pixels visible
# and your display can output without overscan
# at 0, it causes flickering on hdmi output

# uncomment the following to adjust overscan. Use positive numbers if console
# goes off screen, and negative if there is too much border

#hdmi_mode=4

# uncomment to force a HDMI mode rather than DVI. This can make audio work in
# DMT (computer monitor) modes
#hdmi_drive=2

# uncomment will remove all other modes except the ones specified by hdmi_mode and hdmi_group from the internal list
# meaning they will not appear in any enumerated lists of modes.

# allowing passthrough of DTS/AC3 even when this is not reported as supported.
#hdmi_force_edid_audio=1

# uncomment to pretend that all audio formats are unsupported by the display.
# this means ALSA will default to the analogue audio (headphone) jack.
# hdmi_ignore_edid_audio=1
