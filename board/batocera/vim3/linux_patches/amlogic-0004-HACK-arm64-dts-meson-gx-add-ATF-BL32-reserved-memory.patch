Subject: [PATCH 004/152] HACK: arm64: dts: meson-gx: add ATF BL32 reserved
 memory region

Vendor firmware/uboot has an additional reserved region for BL32 trusted
firmware. If a board uses BL32 firmware, booting kernel without knowledge
of this region would cause an immediate kernel panic on SError Interrupt.

TODO: This should be enabled only for boards actually requiring it.
