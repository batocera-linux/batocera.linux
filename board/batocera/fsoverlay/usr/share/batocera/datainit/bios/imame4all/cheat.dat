;          games .
;   -999 : this is used for comments only, cannot be enabled/selected by the

;  -Description of the cheat (normally 29 characters max)
;  -Extra Description line for above (1024 characters max)
;******************************************************************************
;NOTES: The cheat descriptions use the following terms, this is what they
;       actually mean:
;
;Get+Now! means the cheat is a type 01 cheat and so it is a temporary cheat - 
;         it changes the memory and then deactivates. Type 01 is ideal for 
;         getting a particular weapon or feature, also needed for a Finish 
;         Level Now! cheat.
;
;Always   means the cheat is permanent (several cheat types) idea for always
;         having a certain weapon or feature eg always have 3 rainbows on 
;         Rainbow Islands.
;
;Infinite means exactly what it says - you will have an inexhaustible supply of
;         the named item be it lives, time, ammo or something else. On some
;         rare occasions you may need to deactivate the cheat before you can 
;         finish a level, if this need to be done you will see F5 at the end
;         of the cheat description. NB: If using this cheat.dat with a version
;         of MAME before 34B6 you will need to use F7 instead of F5. And it may
;         even be F6 now!
;
;Select current level  - Select a level and you can progress to it by losing a
;                        life. You should only activate this type of cheat 
;                        during game play or according to the comments.
;
;Select next level - Select a level and when you complete the current level you
;                    will progress straight to the selected level. You can also
;                    activate this on the title/attract screens though the
;                    effects cannot always be guaranteed! (you will either
;                    start on the selected level or the next level after the
;                    selected one or level 1). A far better method if you want
;                    to select the starting level from the title screen is to 
;                    use the method that I thought of for Metrocross. See 
;                    Metrocross remarks for info.
;Select Score - This cheat allows you to select your score or/and the other 
;               player's score, ideal for sports games where you need a certain
;               score to win and/or progress. It must ONLY be activated during
;               game play. Also note the score may not display correctly until
;               the score has changed properly!

;New way of doing a Select starting level cheat, this method should work on
;most games. As long as the first cheat conforms to that shown here. In other
;words, take the 'Select next level' cheat rename it to 'Select starting level (2/2)'.
;Then make a new cheat called 'Select starting level' which uses the same
;location as the 2/2 cheat but pokes it with 'FF' or some other unlikely value
;[PLEASE KEEP THIS TO FF AS IT WILL BE EASIER TO FIX IF THE CHEAT ENGINE IS AMMENDED!],
;you should make sure the Cheat type is '021' as this will allow the two cheats
;to be active at the same time - essential for this cheat to work!!
;
;The comments may change according to the game, for example in Metrocross the game will
;enter attract mode if a coin is not inserted and this will screw up the cheat
;as it will reset the memory location to zero. However, for most games it shouldn't
;matter if you enable the cheat on the title screen, the player select or the attract
;screens. Poke the value of the level to something like '05' [not '00' or '01'!] on the
;title screen then put a watch on it - if it changes at all then you will need to add
;a comment to show the problem area or when the cheat should be enabled. If there's no
;problem area then the first 4 comment lines are sufficient. Feel free to interchange
;level, round and stage whenever the game calls them that.
;
;This is cheat method is just a workaround, ideally there should be a new cheat
;type to implement this so the comments would be largely unneeded. However, as
;nobody is improving the cheat engine at the moment this will have to do!
;
;These remarks will stay in until a new cheat type is implemented. [Pugsy:19 DEC 99]

;Not a slideshow but still rather easy, particulary if you combine the Infinite
;Lives, Slow Ball and Bonus Finish Level cheats.
;Open issues:
;- catch every bonus OR catch the ball always - would need a cheat type capable
;  of reading the value at one location (found) and write it at another one, 
;  this could be used for several other games, too... cheat engine enhancement
;  anyone?
;- Bigger Ball. There are a couple of locations easily found with contain 0,1
;  or 2 (the three sizes), but patching those won't do a thing... where's the
;  trigger ?
;- Finish Level Now!. There's a counter with the exact number of tiles 
;  remaining, however it seems to be a copy of something else yet to find since
;  patching it won't do a thing, it becomes reset immediately.

;******************************************************************************

;*********************************************************************************************
;Cheats required : 
;
;The following games do not yet have cheats (Infinite Credits does NOT count as
;a cheat) for at least one of the following reasons (not all reasons will be
;used at any one time):-
;
;1.  The game has not yet been properly emulated by MAME or it crashes when
;    I try to play it :-(. Some games which are broken still have cheats - 
;    however, if it's NOT properly emulated and no good cheats could be found 
;    then reason 1 will be quoted over all other reasons. I also use this reason
;    if I can't figure out the control method or it's too awkward for me to
;    waste time figuring out.
;
;2.  I don't know what cheats to find as the game is hard to understand and is
;    perhaps in a another tongue - eg Japanese. Or the the game doesn't appear
;    suitable for cheat finding. 
;
;3.  I haven't had chance to look at the game for one reason or another - 
;    A  GET OUT! ;-) I may have had a look at the game in the past but I can't
;    remember - I will use this reason in that cas too.
;
;4.  The game has had no RAM areas set up to search in for cheats even with a
;    SCAN ALL AREAS! A lot of cinematronics games currently have this problem 
;    as only 1 ROM area is defined! UPDATE 01 JUL 2001: With the latest cheat
;    engine it is now possible to find cheats for the cinematronics games so 
;    you won't see as many reason 4 games anymore.
;
;5.  The game was only recently fixed and I haven't had a chance to find any
;    cheats yet.
;
;6.  I've got cheat(s) for the game but I haven't had chance to test them or do
;    the cheat description(s).
;
;7.  I've had a quick look at this game and it seems suitable for cheat finding,
;    there's RAM set up - but even a simple search for an Infinite Lives cheat
;    didn't turn up any cheats after whittling down the locations.... These can 
;    be taken as a challenge!!!
;
;8.  The game was added in one of the last versions and I haven't had chance to
;    find any cheats yet. If there is no reason quoted, then it is for this
;    reason.
;
;9.  The game was not in the last official releasable beta binary, some of these
;    'unofficial' games have cheats (Metal Slug X), but this reason is primarily
;    for games that are playable and are likely to make it to a beta binary
;    release soon. This reason will be rarely used!
;
;10. Although it is possible to find cheats for this game, unfortunately the cheats
;    are not constant. IE The next time you load the game (or even reset it) the
;    cheat locations will have changed. This effects a LOT of games, occasionally it 
;    is possible to find the odd cheat though as some locations maybe constant. This
;    dynamic memory location is quite prevalent in neo-geo fighter games - and there
;    maybe some cheats in the cheat file that don't work and this will be the most
;    likely cause. A new cheat type may possibly be required to fix this. 
;    UPDATE: As it's now possible to poke ROM locations it is now possible to make
;    cheats to handle games that use dynamic RAM addressing. However, it require a
;    knowledge of assembler and use of the MAME debugger to find them - at the moment
;    I'm (Pugsy) the only one to produce ROM cheats and I will only be finding them
;    when I get time or I enjoy the game. So the likelihood of ROM cheats for NEO GEO
;    fighters is fairly low - as I'm sick of this type of game. But if I get enough 
;    requests and I'm not too bored I will see what I can do.
;
;11. Nobody has submitted any cheats for this game and I am so sick and tired of this
;    genre I can't motivate myself to find any cheats for this game. However, I 
;    would expect it to be any easy game to find cheats for and you only have to look
;    at games of the same genre to find out which cheats can be found (eg. for baseball
;    games look at another baseball game).
;
;12. There are some cheats for this game but they are either Infinite Credits or some
;    comment cheats - not enough to remove them from this section.

;* games are not listed by MAME as clones but they are, at least from the     *
;* perspective of cheats - which is why this is here!                         *
;*                                                                            *
;* =  means the game uses the same cheats as the game listed before it.       *
;*                                                                            *
;* ~  means the game uses slightly different cheats than the game listed      *
;*    before it.                                                              *
;*                                                                            *
;* =~ means the game uses cheats which are the same AND some are slightly     *
;*    different than the game listed before it                                *
;*                                                                            *
;*   This list of clones will always be based on the latest version of MAME   *
;*   be it a BETA or a FINAL release that is covered by the cheat file!!      *
;*   Almost inevitably this clone list will contain errors, due to the nature *
;*   of it being updated as an afterthought and being manually updated.       *
;*
;*   This list of clones is only valid for RAM cheats - ROM cheats and dip    *
;*   switches vary too frequently betweeen games.                             *

;*                    ABOUT THE CHEAT DESCRIPTION FORMAT                      *
;******************************************************************************
;
; This is how I order the cheats - I try and stick to it as oftewn as I can.
; Some games don't conform to this standard either because it's better as is or
; the cheats were done a while ago and I haven't changed them. DO NOT report any
; games that don't follow this standard - it's pretty low in my list of priorities
; right now.
;
; OVERALL CHEAT ORDER
; *******************
;
; gamename in format '; [ long game name ]'
; section1
; section2
; section3
;
; WHAT'S EACH SECTION ABOUT?
; **************************
;
; Section 1 contains all the cheats valid for all players. Infinite Credits will come first normally
;
; Section 2 contains cheats for individual players, split up so that all PL1 cheats are together and all
; PL2 cheats are together. Normally there will be the same cheats for each player and the order of the 
; cheats should be the same as for the other player
;
; Section 3 contains any none cheat related things. Eg Like sound test timer and region switch  codes.
;
; WHAT'S IN EACH SECTION
; **********************
;
; The normal order of cheats will be if there is no PL1 or PL2 specific cheats. If a cheat is specific to 
; all players it will promote it up the list.
;
; Infinite Credits
; Infinite Time       (if 'Finish this Round Now!' is worthwhile it should directly follow this cheat)
; Infinite Lives
; Infinite Energy     (if 'Drain all Energy Now!' is worthwhile it should directly follow this cheat)
; Infinite Ammo
; Infinite Bombs
; Invincibility
; Always have this weapon 
; Get this weapon Now!
; Play with this character Now!
; Select starting level
; Select current level
; Select next level

;*                    GAMES THAT CURRENTLY UTILISE ROM CHEATS                 *
;******************************************************************************
;
; Games utilising ROM cheats (individual credits will be given due to the extra work
; and skill - though only for cheats where RAM cheats are either not possible 
; (or sometimes it is actually a LOT quicker to make a ROM hack than find a RAM one)
; or buggy! ;-)):-
;
; I'm keeping this list as I will find it useful to for testing purposes when the
; cheat engine changes...especially for processors with endian (big and little)
; issues. For the moment it's not alphabetically sorted on purpose.

;*           GAMES/CHEATS WITH KNOWN ISSUES OR WORK STILL TO BE DONE          *
;******************************************************************************
;
; Don't expect this list to change too much - there's more pressing issues for
; me to deal with normally - I do have a crack at them occasionally.
;
; Rework cheats with '//' comment lines to cheat type 999 wherever a better
; explanation is required (not Use Sprite when flickers type comments as this
; will overcomplicate matters for now) - ONGOING
; Look at Ali Baba - uses pacman hardware may use same cheats...
; Look at Aurail - round 2 looks to be a different game - cheats may not work 
; after round 1...
; Check out all the Neo Geo fighting games like Samurai Shodown, it appears that
; the energy cheats don't work - looks like an 'Exterminator' situation. UPDATE
; PUGSY 02 AUG 2001 - I found the problem with Samurai Showdown and other neo geo
; fighters I can resolve this by using a relative address with index to make good RAM
; cheats, I've asked for a new cheat type to do this and Ian Patterson has agreed :-)
; This new cheat type will not be available to at least 0.55 and the bit cheat
; engine. To find these cheats you will need a debugger MAME compile.
; More cheats for Finest Hour
; Look at Mirai Ninja
; Punisher weapon cheats - if possible
; Look at replicating Mania Challenge cheats for The Main Event
; More Kung Fu Master cheats
; Spy Hunter 2 needs more cheats!
; The Return of Ishtar needs more work - present cheats has problems in b12 ...
; Smash TV - look at Invincibility for PL2, perhaps somebody good and with more
; time then me could look at some working weapon cheats! ;-P Also need to double
; check the clones - they are not quite identical it seems.
; More codes for 88 Games
; I, Robot more codes needed
; Streaking more codes needed
; Sky Kid Deluxe more codes needed
; Plump Pop more codes needed
; Hopping Mappy more codes needed
; Black Hole more codes needed
; Baluba-louk no Densetsu more codes?
; Knock Out/Triple Punch - Look at the invincibilty cheats
; Nibbler - Look at making some short snake cheats
; My Hero - Round Select codes
; mrdoy - requires invincibility cheats
; Mr Do.!  - level select cheats
; Mutant Night - level select cheats
; Millipede - look at improving the invincibility cheat
; Gradius III - have a look at the cheat descriptions and find more (job for me[Pugsy])
; Last Mission - look for weapon cheats at least..
; Gauntlet - look at replicating Freeze All Enemies cheat for all Gauntlet Clones
; Colony 7 - look at set fighter =1 cheat is it worthwhile
; Depthcharge - infinite charges should be possible
; Zig Zag - invincibility cheats, use Dig Dug as a guide
; Syougi No Tatsujin - more cheats?
; Dangerous Seed - check cheats and find more?
; Flash Gal - check for level select cheats
; Fighting Hawk - take a closer look at this game, start on level cheats perhaps
; Cosmo Gang the Video - check out both versions unsure which is NOW the original
; one the cheat was made for.
; Atari Soccer - need to search for score cheats, no patience to play with controls
; Kick and Run - needs score cheats
; Look at Fatal Fury 4 cheats - rename add more?
; Body Slam - room for lots more cheats, see other wrestling games for possible cheats
; Check out the cheats for these clones, I haven't had chance to check them:-
;  aliensu   darkseaj   devstor3    galag88b   grdius3a   marvlanj
;  pinbos     skykiddo  youma      mrvikinj    blswhstl   pacnchmp   poleposa
; More cheats for Big Pro Wrestling! needed
; More cheats for Bosconian (invincibility)
; Replicate invincibility cheats for the Shoot Out clones
; Check out Shinobi (set 3) cheats
; Check out sdioj cheats when the game is fixed
; More cheats for Yosaku To Donbee
; More cheats for Tank Force - in particular a cheat to activate the Air Strike
; Look for 'Infinite "item" time' cheats for red and green pills for PacMania
; Test aliensyj
; Check for Stakes Winner & Stakes Winner 2 PL2 cheats
; Add Select score cheats for the Super Sidekicks series of games
; Do Infinite Health, Infinite Ammo, Always have Gun/Get Gun Now! cheats for all levels 
;  and both players for the game Top Hunter
; Ultraman look at cheats and check....problems encountered
; Look at Quester - more arkanoid pill type cheats?
; War of Aero - loads of scope for more cheats - weapons + level for starters (see dip switches)
; Astro Blaster (version 2) + other versions? - cheats seem buggy and causes gfx glitches, investigate
; More cheats for cachat - when I've had chance to play it......
; '99 The Last War + clones - Shield stays on longer cheat seems to be cosmetic only. Fix or remove
; Rename 'type' cheats for dfeveron, requires better descriptions
; Check out all select and temporary cheats for 37 beta 2 games when cheat engine is completed
; Look at more Great 1000 Miles Rally cheats, max speed at all times for example
; Dream Soccer '94 - look at Select Score cheats for PL1 and penalty kickoff cheats
; Add Score always, score now! or select score cheats for games with only one type (perhaps)
; Gotya - find invincibility cheat + others
; Labyrinth Runner - weapon cheats required + level select
; Passing Shot - check all cheats, order make them hard to understand.....(I hate Tennis games)
; More cheats for invad2ct - Space Invaders II
; Check out Spinal Breakers - don't understand the 2 part cheats, redo descriptions when done + some 
;  locations should be 2 part (like time)
; Missing PL2 cheats for Ghox to be found and all cheats to be cleaned up
; More cheats for V-Five (use Grind Stormer as an example - very similar! + clean up cheats especially
;  the rough and ready cursor cheat
; More cheats for Fast Lane
; More cheats for Snow Bros. 2
; Twin Eagle - find missing Maximum Speed PL2 cheat
; Air Buster - possible trigger cheat missing from Side shot, Powerball & B cheats. Investigate
; Soldam (Japan) - possibility of a lot more colour related cheats, + needs some other cheats
; Do some work on reducing the above entries!!! ;-)
; Spinal Breakers - more cheats to be found - weapons, time, invincibility....
; U.S. Classic - more cheats required, PL2 cheats not yet possible! (beta 1)
; Zing Zing Zip - problem reported with goto boss cheats - redo as a level select and start on level cheat
