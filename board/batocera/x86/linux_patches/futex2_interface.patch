Subject: [PATCH 01/14] futex2: Implement wait and wake functions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Create a new set of futex syscalls known as futex2. This new interface
is aimed to implement a more maintainable code, while removing obsolete
features and expanding it with new functionalities.

Implements wait and wake semantics for futexes, along with the base
infrastructure for future operations. The whole wait path is designed to
be used by N waiters, thus making easier to implement vectorized wait.

* Syscalls implemented by this patch:

- futex_wait(void *uaddr, unsigned int val, unsigned int flags,
	     struct timespec *timo)

   The user thread is put to sleep, waiting for a futex_wake() at uaddr,
   if the value at *uaddr is the same as val (otherwise, the syscall
   returns immediately with -EAGAIN). timo is an optional timeout value
   for the operation.

   Return 0 on success, error code otherwise.

 - futex_wake(void *uaddr, unsigned long nr_wake, unsigned int flags)

   Wake `nr_wake` threads waiting at uaddr.

   Return the number of woken threads on success, error code otherwise.

** The `flag` argument

 The flag is used to specify the size of the futex word
 (FUTEX_[8, 16, 32]). It's mandatory to define one, since there's no
 default size.

 By default, the timeout uses a monotonic clock, but can be used as a realtime
 one by using the FUTEX_REALTIME_CLOCK flag.

 By default, futexes are of the private type, that means that this user address
 will be accessed by threads that shares the same memory region. This allows for
 some internal optimizations, so they are faster. However, if the address needs
 to be shared with different processes (like using `mmap()` or `shm()`), they
 need to be defined as shared and the flag FUTEX_SHARED_FLAG is used to set that.

 By default, the operation has no NUMA-awareness, meaning that the user can't
 choose the memory node where the kernel side futex data will be stored. The
 user can choose the node where it wants to operate by setting the
 FUTEX_NUMA_FLAG and using the following structure (where X can be 8, 16, or
 32):

  struct futexX_numa {
          __uX value;
          __sX hint;
  };

 This structure should be passed at the `void *uaddr` of futex functions. The
 address of the structure will be used to be waited/waken on, and the
 `value` will be compared to `val` as usual. The `hint` member is used to
 defined which node the futex will use. When waiting, the futex will be
 registered on a kernel-side table stored on that node; when waking, the futex
 will be searched for on that given table. That means that there's no redundancy
 between tables, and the wrong `hint` value will led to undesired behavior.
 Userspace is responsible for dealing with node migrations issues that may
 occur. `hint` can range from [0, MAX_NUMA_NODES], for specifying a node, or
 -1, to use the same node the current process is using.

 When not using FUTEX_NUMA_FLAG on a NUMA system, the futex will be stored on a
 global table on some node, defined at compilation time.

** The `timo` argument

As per the Y2038 work done in the kernel, new interfaces shouldn't add timeout
options known to be buggy. Given that, `timo` should be a 64bit timeout at
all platforms, using an absolute timeout value.

Subject: [PATCH 02/14] futex2: Add support for shared futexes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add support for shared futexes for cross-process resources. This design
relies on the same approach done in old futex to create an unique id for
file-backed shared memory, by using a counter at struct inode.

There are two types of futexes: private and shared ones. The private are futexes
meant to be used by threads that shares the same memory space, are easier to be
uniquely identified an thus can have some performance optimization. The elements
for identifying one are: the start address of the page where the address is,
the address offset within the page and the current->mm pointer.

Now, for uniquely identifying shared futex:

- If the page containing the user address is an anonymous page, we can
  just use the same data used for private futexes (the start address of
  the page, the address offset within the page and the current->mm
  pointer) that will be enough for uniquely identifying such futex. We
  also set one bit at the key to differentiate if a private futex is
  used on the same address (mixing shared and private calls are not
  allowed).

- If the page is file-backed, current->mm maybe isn't the same one for
  every user of this futex, so we need to use other data: the
  page->index, an UUID for the struct inode and the offset within the
  page.

Note that members of futex_key doesn't have any particular meaning after they
are part of the struct - they are just bytes to identify a futex.  Given that,
we don't need to use a particular name or type that matches the original data,
we only need to care about the bitsize of each component and make both private
and shared data fit in the same memory space.

Subject: [PATCH 03/14] futex2: Implement vectorized wait
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add support to wait on multiple futexes. This is the interface
implemented by this syscall:

futex_waitv(struct futex_waitv *waiters, unsigned int nr_futexes,
	    unsigned int flags, struct timespec *timo)

struct futex_waitv {
	void *uaddr;
	unsigned int val;
	unsigned int flags;
};

Given an array of struct futex_waitv, wait on each uaddr. The thread
wakes if a futex_wake() is performed at any uaddr. The syscall returns
immediately if any waiter has *uaddr != val. *timo is an optional
timeout value for the operation. The flags argument of the syscall
should be used solely for specifying the timeout as realtime, if needed.
Flags for shared futexes, sizes, etc. should be used on the individual
flags of each waiter.

Returns the array index of one of the awakened futexes. Thereâ€™s no given
information of how many were awakened, or any particular attribute of it
(if itâ€™s the first awakened, if it is of the smaller index...).

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Implement requeue interface similary to FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE operation.
This is the syscall implemented by this patch:

futex_requeue(struct futex_requeue *uaddr1, struct futex_requeue *uaddr2,
	      unsigned int nr_wake, unsigned int nr_requeue,
	      unsigned int cmpval, unsigned int flags)

struct futex_requeue {
	void *uaddr;
	unsigned int flags;
};

If (uaddr1->uaddr == cmpval), wake at uaddr1->uaddr a nr_wake number of
waiters and then, remove a number of nr_requeue waiters at uaddr1->uaddr
and add them to uaddr2->uaddr list. Each uaddr has its own set of flags,
that must be defined at struct futex_requeue (such as size, shared, NUMA).
The flags argument of the syscall is there just for the sake of
extensibility, and right now it needs to be zero.

Return the number of the woken futexes + the number of requeued ones on
success, error code otherwise.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

New syscalls should use the same entry point for x86_64 and x86_x32
paths. Add a wrapper for x32 calls to use parse functions that assumes
32bit pointers.

+
+futex, or fast user mutex, is a set of syscalls to allow userspace to create
+performant synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes, semaphores and
+conditional variables in userspace. C standard libraries, like glibc, uses it
+as a means to implement more high level interfaces like pthreads.
+
+The interface
+=============
+
+uAPI functions
+--------------
+
+.. kernel-doc:: kernel/futex2.c
+   :identifiers: sys_futex_wait sys_futex_wake sys_futex_waitv sys_futex_requeue
+
+uAPI structures
+---------------
+
+.. kernel-doc:: include/uapi/linux/futex.h
+
+The ``flag`` argument
+---------------------
+
+The flag is used to specify the size of the futex word
+(FUTEX_[8, 16, 32]). It's mandatory to define one, since there's no
+default size.
+
+By default, the timeout uses a monotonic clock, but can be used as a realtime
+one by using the FUTEX_REALTIME_CLOCK flag.
+
+By default, futexes are of the private type, that means that this user address
+will be accessed by threads that share the same memory region. This allows for
+some internal optimizations, so they are faster. However, if the address needs
+to be shared with different processes (like using ``mmap()`` or ``shm()``), they
+need to be defined as shared and the flag FUTEX_SHARED_FLAG is used to set that.
+
+By default, the operation has no NUMA-awareness, meaning that the user can't
+choose the memory node where the kernel side futex data will be stored. The
+user can choose the node where it wants to operate by setting the
+FUTEX_NUMA_FLAG and using the following structure (where X can be 8, 16, or
+32)::
+
+ struct futexX_numa {
+         __uX value;
+         __sX hint;
+ };
+
+This structure should be passed at the ``void *uaddr`` of futex functions. The
+address of the structure will be used to be waited on/waken on, and the
+``value`` will be compared to ``val`` as usual. The ``hint`` member is used to
+define which node the futex will use. When waiting, the futex will be
+registered on a kernel-side table stored on that node; when waking, the futex
+will be searched for on that given table. That means that there's no redundancy
+between tables, and the wrong ``hint`` value will lead to undesired behavior.
+Userspace is responsible for dealing with node migrations issues that may
+occur. ``hint`` can range from [0, MAX_NUMA_NODES), for specifying a node, or
+-1, to use the same node the current process is using.
+
+When not using FUTEX_NUMA_FLAG on a NUMA system, the futex will be stored on a
+global table on allocated on the first node.
+
+The ``timo`` argument
+---------------------
+
+As per the Y2038 work done in the kernel, new interfaces shouldn't add timeout
+options known to be buggy. Given that, ``timo`` should be a 64-bit timeout at
+all platforms, using an absolute timeout value.
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+The internal implementation follows a similar design to the original futex.
+Given that we want to replicate the same external behavior of current futex,
+this should be somewhat expected.
+
+Waiting
+-------
+
+For the wait operations, they are all treated as if you want to wait on N
+futexes, so the path for futex_wait and futex_waitv is the basically the same.
+For both syscalls, the first step is to prepare an internal list for the list
+of futexes to wait for (using struct futexv_head). For futex_wait() calls, this
+list will have a single object.
+
+We have a hash table, where waiters register themselves before sleeping. Then
+the wake function checks this table looking for waiters at uaddr.  The hash
+bucket to be used is determined by a struct futex_key, that stores information
+to uniquely identify an address from a given process. Given the huge address
+space, there'll be hash collisions, so we store information to be later used on
+collision treatment.
+
+First, for every futex we want to wait on, we check if (``*uaddr == val``).
+This check is done holding the bucket lock, so we are correctly serialized with
+any futex_wake() calls. If any waiter fails the check above, we dequeue all
+futexes. The check (``*uaddr == val``) can fail for two reasons:
+
+- The values are different, and we return -EAGAIN. However, if while
+  dequeueing we found that some futexes were awakened, we prioritize this
+  and return success.
+
+- When trying to access the user address, we do so with page faults
+  disabled because we are holding a bucket's spin lock (and can't sleep
+  while holding a spin lock). If there's an error, it might be a page
+  fault, or an invalid address. We release the lock, dequeue everyone
+  (because it's illegal to sleep while there are futexes enqueued, we
+  could lose wakeups) and try again with page fault enabled. If we
+  succeed, this means that the address is valid, but we need to do
+  all the work again. For serialization reasons, we need to have the
+  spin lock when getting the user value. Additionally, for shared
+  futexes, we also need to recalculate the hash, since the underlying
+  mapping mechanisms could have changed when dealing with page fault.
+  If, even with page fault enabled, we can't access the address, it
+  means it's an invalid user address, and we return -EFAULT. For this
+  case, we prioritize the error, even if some futexes were awaken.
+
+If the check is OK, they are enqueued on a linked list in our bucket, and
+proceed to the next one. If all waiters succeed, we put the thread to sleep
+until a futex_wake() call, timeout expires or we get a signal. After waking up,
+we dequeue everyone, and check if some futex was awakened. This dequeue is done
+by iteratively walking at each element of struct futex_head list.
+
+All enqueuing/dequeuing operations requires to hold the bucket lock, to avoid
+racing while modifying the list.
+
+Waking
+------
+
+We get the bucket that's storing the waiters at uaddr, and wake the required
+number of waiters, checking for hash collision.
+
+There's an optimization that makes futex_wake() not take the bucket lock if
+there's no one to be woken on that bucket. It checks an atomic counter that each
+bucket has, if it says 0, then the syscall exits. In order for this to work, the
+waiter thread increases it before taking the lock, so the wake thread will
+correctly see that there's someone waiting and will continue the path to take
+the bucket lock. To get the correct serialization, the waiter issues a memory
+barrier after increasing the bucket counter and the waker issues a memory
+barrier before checking it.
+
+Requeuing
+---------
+
+The requeue path first checks for each struct futex_requeue and their flags.
+Then, it will compare the expected value with the one at uaddr1::uaddr.
+Following the same serialization explained at Waking_, we increase the atomic
+counter for the bucket of uaddr2 before taking the lock. We need to have both
+buckets locks at same time so we don't race with other futex operation. To
+ensure the locks are taken in the same order for all threads (and thus avoiding
+deadlocks), every requeue operation takes the "smaller" bucket first, when
+comparing both addresses.
+
+If the compare with user value succeeds, we proceed by waking ``nr_wake``
+futexes, and then requeuing ``nr_requeue`` from bucket of uaddr1 to the uaddr2.
+This consists in a simple list deletion/addition and replacing the old futex key
+with the new one.
+
+Futex keys
+----------
+
+There are two types of futexes: private and shared ones. The private are futexes
+meant to be used by threads that share the same memory space, are easier to be
+uniquely identified and thus can have some performance optimization. The
+elements for identifying one are: the start address of the page where the
+address is, the address offset within the page and the current->mm pointer.
+
+Now, for uniquely identifying a shared futex:
+
+- If the page containing the user address is an anonymous page, we can
+  just use the same data used for private futexes (the start address of
+  the page, the address offset within the page and the current->mm
+  pointer); that will be enough for uniquely identifying such futex. We
+  also set one bit at the key to differentiate if a private futex is
+  used on the same address (mixing shared and private calls does not
+  work).
+
+- If the page is file-backed, current->mm maybe isn't the same one for
+  every user of this futex, so we need to use other data: the
+  page->index, a UUID for the struct inode and the offset within the
+  page.
+
+Note that members of futex_key don't have any particular meaning after they
+are part of the struct - they are just bytes to identify a futex.  Given that,
+we don't need to use a particular name or type that matches the original data,
+we only need to care about the bitsize of each component and make both private
+and shared fit in the same memory space.

Subject: [PATCH 07/14] selftests: futex2: Add wake/wait test
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add a simple file to test wake/wait mechanism using futex2 interface.
Test three scenarios: using a common local int variable as private
futex, a shm futex as shared futex and a file-backed shared memory as a
shared futex. This should test all branches of futex_get_key().

Create helper files so more tests can evaluate futex2. While 32bit ABIs
from glibc aren't yet able to use 64 bit sized time variables, add a
temporary workaround that implements the required types and calls the
appropriated syscalls, since futex2 doesn't supports 32 bit sized time.

Subject: [PATCH 10/14] selftests: futex2: Add waitv test
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Create a new file to test the waitv mechanism. Test both private and
shared futexes. Wake the last futex in the array, and check if the
return value from futex_waitv() is the right index.

Subject: [PATCH 11/14] selftests: futex2: Add requeue test
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add testing for futex_requeue(). The first test just requeue from one
waiter to another one, and wake it. The second performs both wake and
requeue, and we check return values to see if the operation
woke/requeued the expected number of waiters.

Subject: [PATCH 12/14] perf bench: Add futex2 benchmark tests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add support at the existing futex benchmarking code base to enable
futex2 calls. `perf bench` tests can be used not only as a way to
measure the performance of implementation, but also as stress testing
for the kernel infrastructure.

Subject: [PATCH 13/14] kernel: Enable waitpid() for futex2
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

To make pthreads works as expected if they are using futex2, wake
clear_child_tid with futex2 as well. This is make applications that uses
waitpid() (and clone(CLONE_CHILD_SETTID)) wake while waiting for the
child to terminate. Given that apps should not mix futex() and futex2(),
any correct app will trigger a harmless noop wakeup on the interface
that it isn't using.

Subject: [PATCH 14/14] futex2: Add sysfs entry for syscall numbers
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In the course of futex2 development, it will be rebased on top of
different kernel releases, and the syscall number can change in this
process. Expose futex2 syscall number via sysfs so tools that are
experimenting with futex2 (like Proton/Wine) can test it and set the
syscall number at runtime, rather than setting it at compilation time.
