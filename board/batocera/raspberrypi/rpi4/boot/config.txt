# uncomment will lead to "safe mode" settings being used to try to boot with maximum HDMI compatibility.
#hdmi_safe=1

# uncomment this if your display has a black border of unused pixels visible
# and your display can output without overscan
# at 0, it causes flickering on hdmi output
disable_overscan=1

# uncomment the following to adjust overscan. Use positive numbers if console
# goes off screen, and negative if there is too much border
#overscan_left=16
#overscan_right=16

#hdmi_force_hotplug=1

# uncomment the hdmi_group command which defines the HDMI output group to be either...
# 1 use CEA (Consumer Electronics Association, the standard typically used by TVs) or
# 2 use DMT (Display Monitor Timings, the standard typically used by monitors).
# This setting should be used in conjunction with hdmi_mode.

# uncomment to apply an appropriate CEA or DMT mode for your display
# see the web site below for valid options depending on the hdmi_group setting
# https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md
#hdmi_mode=4

# uncomment to force a HDMI mode rather than DVI. This can make audio work in
# DMT (computer monitor) modes
#hdmi_drive=2

# uncomment will remove all other modes except the ones specified by hdmi_mode and hdmi_group from the internal list
# meaning they will not appear in any enumerated lists of modes.
# this option may help if a display seems to be ignoring the hdmi_mode and hdmi_group settings.

# 3 = EDID_ContentType_Cinema, content type cinema
# 4 = EDID_ContentType_Game, content type game

# if you plug your tv at the same time as your rpi and that the rpi switches from the hdmi or give a low resolution because tv had no enough time to initialize it

# note: slightly slows down the entire system on Pi 4 models.

# uncomment for composite mode.
# 0 Normal NTSC (defult)
# 1 Japanese version of NTSC – no pedestal
# 2 Normal PAL
# 3 Brazilian version of PAL – 525/60 rather than 625/50, different subcarrier
# 16 Progressive scan NTSC
# 18 Progressive scan PAL
#sdtv_mode=2

# uncomment to define the wide aspect ratio for composite video output above.
# 1	4:3 (default)
# 2	14:9
# 3	16:9
#sdtv_aspect=3

# uncomment if you have slow sound issues on composite output
#audio_pwm_mode=0

# uncomment to pretend that all audio formats are supported by the display
# allowing passthrough of DTS/AC3 even when this is not reported as supported.
#hdmi_force_edid_audio=1

# uncomment to pretend that all audio formats are unsupported by the display.
# this means ALSA will default to the analogue audio (headphone) jack.
# hdmi_ignore_edid_audio=1

# uncomment to avoid the firmware parsing the EDID of any HDMI attached display
# that way the Linux video mode system (KMS) will then parse the EDID itself and pick an appropriate mode.
