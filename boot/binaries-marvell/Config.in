	  Some systems, including Marvell Armada SoC, have a separate
	  System Control Processor (SCP) for power management, clocks,
	  reset and system control. ATF Boot Loader stage 2 (BL2) loads
	  optional SCP_BL2 image into a platform-specific region
	  of secure memory. This package downloads and installs such
	  firmware, which is needed to build ATF.
