	  The SoX Resampler library `libsoxr' performs one-dimensional
	  sample-rate conversion. It may be used, for example, to
	  resample PCM-encoded audio.

	  It aims to give fast and high quality results for any constant
	  (rational or irrational) resampling ratio. Phase-response,
	  preserved bandwidth, aliasing, and rejection level parameters
	  are all configurable; alternatively, simple `preset'
	  configurations may be selected. An experimental, variable-rate
	  resampling mode of operation is also included.
