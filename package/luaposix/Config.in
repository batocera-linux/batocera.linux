	  This is a POSIX binding for LuaJIT, Lua 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3;
	  like most libraries it simply binds to C APIs on the
	  underlying system, so it won't work on non-POSIX systems.
	  However, it does try to detect the level of POSIX conformance
	  of the underlying system and bind only available APIs.
