	  The source code to implement ARB_texture_float extension is
	  included and can be toggled on at compile time, for those
	  who purchased a license from SGI, or are in a country where
	  the patent does not apply, etc.

	  Please consult docs/patents.txt with your lawyer before
	  building Mesa.

	  Also, note that this option doesn't affect all drivers. Some
	  drivers have support for texture float enabled
	  unconditionally.

	  If unsure, say N.
