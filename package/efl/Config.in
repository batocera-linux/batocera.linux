	help
	  If you have chosen to disable physics support, this disables
	  lots of core functionality and is effectively never
	  tested. You are going to find features that suddenly don't
	  work and as a result cause a series of breakages. This is
	  simply not tested so you are on your own in terms of
	  ensuring everything works if you do this.

	  Eeze is EFL's hardware abstraction layer on top of udev.

	help
	  If fontconfig is disabled, this is going to make general
	  font searching not work, and only some very direct 'load
	  /path/file.ttf' will work alongside some old-school ttf file
	  path searching. This is very likely not what you want, so
	  highly reconsider turning fontconfig off. Having it off will
	  lead to visual problems like missing text in many UI areas

	  Fribidi is used for handling right-to-left text (like

	  a feature you want to disable unless you know for absolute
	  certain you will never encounter and have to display such
	  scripts. Also note that we don't test with fribidi disabled
	  so you may also trigger code paths with bugs that are never
	  normally used.

	  The only audio output method supported by Ecore right now is
