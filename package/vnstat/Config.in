	  vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor that keeps a
	  log of network traffic for the selected interface(s). It uses
	  the network interface statistics provided by the kernel as
	  information source. This means that vnStat won't actually be
	  sniffing any traffic and also ensures light use of system
	  resources.
