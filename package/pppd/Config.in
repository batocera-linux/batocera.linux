	  Overwrite /etc/resolv.conf instead of maintaining the
	  separate list of nameservers in /etc/ppp/resolv.conf

	  Note that the pppd default of writing to /etc/ppp/resolv.conf
	  does not work on a read-only rootfs unless you make it
	  writable in your rootfs customizations (e.g. by linking it to
	  a file in tmpfs or by mounting a writable filesystem on it).
