	  eCryptfs is a POSIX-compliant enterprise cryptographic
	  filesystem for Linux. It is stacked on top of any other
	  Linux filesystem, it stores cryptographic metadata in the
	  header of each file written.

	  The eCryptfs kernel module is available in all Linux kernels
	  since version 2.6.19. This package provides userspace
	  utilities needed to mount eCryptfs.

	  Files are encrypted using a passphrase. Consider building
	  openssl for another method.
