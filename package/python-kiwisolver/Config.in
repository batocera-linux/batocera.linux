	  Kiwi is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary
	  constraint solving algorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of
	  the algorithm based on the seminal Cassowary paper. It is
	  not a refactoring of the original C++ solver. Kiwi has been
	  designed from the ground up to be lightweight and fast. Kiwi
	  ranges from 10x to 500x faster than the original Cassowary
	  solver with typical use cases gaining a 40x
	  improvement. Memory savings are consistently > 5x.
