	  ImageMagick(R) is a software suite to create, edit, and
	  compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images
	  in a variety of formats (about 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF,
	  JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF.
	  Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
	  shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various
	  special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and
	  BÃ©zier curves.

	help
	  Say 'y' here is you need ImageMagick tools (like convert)
	  to support SVG.

	  This is not enabled by default, as it brings quite a few
	  extra dependencies, and thus extra build time.
