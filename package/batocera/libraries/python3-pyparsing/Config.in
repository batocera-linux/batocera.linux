	  The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating
	  and executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc
	  approach, or the use of regular expressions. The pyparsing
	  module provides a library of classes that client code uses
	  to construct the grammar directly in Python code.
