description = "A port of the Flycast Dreamcast emulator to libretro. In addition to Dreamcast, the core also supports the NAOMI and Atomiswave arcade platforms (with appropriate BIOS images) and will load these games from the latest MAME ROMset. This version of the core uses advanced graphics API features, so anyone using an older, limited GPU may need to use the GLES2 version if this one is incompatible with their hardware."
