TIPS:
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key [ ~ ] and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key [ ~ ] and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

$info=harddriv
$mame
INITIALIZATION:
If you are having trouble controlling vehicle or the brake is always on, calibration must be done!
First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).
Abort: Maps to Player 2 start button (default: [ 2 ] key).

Finally, here is a step-by-step tour through the calibration process. Note that even if you have an analog control connected to any of the analog controls in the game, it is much easier to do calibration with the keyboard.
* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

TIPS:
Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

INITIALIZATION:
If you are having trouble controlling vehicle or the brake is always on, calibration must be done!
First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).
Abort: Maps to Player 2 start button (default: [ 2 ] key).

Finally, here is a step-by-step tour through the calibration process. Note that even if you have an analog control connected to any of the analog controls in the game, it is much easier to do calibration with the keyboard.
* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

INITIALIZATION:
If you are having trouble controlling vehicle or the brake is always on, calibration must be done!
First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).
Abort: Maps to Player 2 start button (default: [ 2 ] key).

Finally, here is a step-by-step tour through the calibration process. Note that even if you have an analog control connected to any of the analog controls in the game, it is much easier to do calibration with the keyboard.
* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

INITIALIZATION:
The first time you run the game, you must perform the typical Konami [ F2 ]+[ F3 ] procedure to properly initialize the EEPROM. The problem is this game does not currently give any types of feedback like the other Konami games (due to video problems). Simply hold [ F2 ] down, hit [ F3 ] - continuing to hold [ F2 ] for a couple of seconds to make sure it takes. Shortly thereafter, you should see a test pattern on screen signifying it worked.

TIPS:
Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?

Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.


How to activate Blood?

Hit [ F2 ], use the player 1 controls to navigate to "Setting up the soft dip", hit the primary button (Left Control), navigate to "Slot 1 (game name)", hit the primary button and finally navigate to the "Blood" selection and turn it on by hitting the primary button. To exit the menu, press the third button (Space) two times and select "Exit".

TIPS:
Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

How to activate Blood?
Hit [ F2 ], use the player 1 controls to navigate to "Setting up the soft dip", hit the primary button (Left Control), navigate to "Slot 1 (game name)", hit the primary button and finally navigate to the "Blood" selection and turn it on by hitting the primary button. To exit the menu, press the third button (Space) two times and select "Exit".

At the first start, the game will stop displaying some errors (E160, E166 and E124): with [ F2 ] you enter the "MAIN MENU". Press exactly this key sequence: [ Ctlr ], [ Ctlr ], [ 1 ], [ Alt ], [ 1 ], [ Alt ], [ 1 ], [ Alt ] and [ 1 ]. At this point there will be two errors (E166 and E124); this is the second sequence that initializes the sound card: [ F2 ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ] [ 1 ], [ Alt ], [1], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ] and [ 1 ]. Now there is only the "E166 RTC UNFORMAT" error, which can be solved with this sequence: [ F2 ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [1], [ Alt ], [1], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ Alt ], [ 1 ] and [ Shift ]+[ F3 ].

INITIALIZATION:
If you are having trouble controlling vehicle or the brake is always on, calibration must be done!
First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).
Abort: Maps to Player 2 start button (default: [ 2 ] key).

Finally, here is a step-by-step tour through the calibration process. Note that even if you have an analog control connected to any of the analog controls in the game, it is much easier to do calibration with the keyboard.
* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

TIPS:
Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

TIPS:
Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

INITIALIZATION:
If you are having trouble controlling vehicle or the brake is always on, calibration must be done!
First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).

* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

TIPS:
Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

INITIALIZATION:
If you are having trouble controlling vehicle or the brake is always on, calibration must be done!
First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.

INITIALIZATION:
There is no avoiding the NVRAM initialization process. In order to use any game that is not labeled (NO CD), the game must be allowed to create a complete and valid NVRAM file. This process takes nearly an hour and only needs to be done once. Once a proper NVRAM is created, the game will start quickly.

TIPS:
The volume for this game is TOO LOW!

When the game is running, hit [ F2 ] to get to the internal service menu. Hit [ F2 ] again to "close" the service switch so that you won't get stuck in the menu. Now, navigate to the "Volume Adjust" option (following the directions provided) and adjust the volume. It's best to keep the volume no more than 80-90% filled as it might cause your sound to be overdriven and crackle. When adjusted, simply exit the menu.

How do I calibrate the guns? Can I use a real light gun?

The game will automatically ask you to calibrate the guns when you start the game for the first time. Simply put, use your mouse or keyboard to "target" the top left corner when the game asks so. There aren't any visual cues to help this, so you'll have to go by the numerical coordinates that are visible on the screen. The numbers you see are in a simple 8-bit scale going from 0 to 255. To "target" the top left corner, keep moving your mouse until you get P1 X and P1 Y as near to 0 as possible. The middle is located at about 127, 127, and the bottom right corner as close to 255 as possible. Repeat the process for the second player. As for the light gun, the short answer is no. A longer answer is that the game didn't actually have a light gun — it had analog joysticks mounted as guns, and emulating them with a proper light gun is not viable. Try to use mouse control with this game.

TIPS:
The volume for this game is TOO LOW!
When the game is running, hit [ F2 ] to get to the internal service menu. Hit [ F2 ] again to "close" the service switch so that you won't get stuck in the menu. Now, navigate to the "Volume Adjust" option (following the directions provided) and adjust the volume. It's best to keep the volume no more than 80-90% filled as it might cause your sound to be overdriven and crackle. When adjusted, simply exit the menu.

TIPS:
You need to calibrate the game each time it is played. The calibration settings are not saved at the moment (lack of nvram support) but the settings are kept in memory using [ F3 ] after setting, so once set you can play with the calibrated settings.

TO SET: Use [ F2 ] (Service Mode) and then reset [ F3 ] or restart MAME. Use [ CTRL ] or [ ALT ] and highlight "7. Gun Adjust Mode". Hit [ 1 ] (P1 Start) two times to begin gun adjustments. Just follow the directions, aiming at the targets for both guns. When done, use [ F2 ] to shut off Service Mode and reset [ F3 ]. It is important not to hard reset or restart MAME, doing such would lose the gun settings and you'll need to re-calibrate.
