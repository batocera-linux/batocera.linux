	  Wine is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows
	  applications on Linux. Instead of simulating internal
	  Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine
	  translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly,
	  eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other
	  methods.

	  This is the custom Glorius Eggroll version.
	  Whih is based on/forked from the most recent bleeding-edge proton experimental wine repo.
	  This is meant to be used with non-steam games outside of Steam.
