	  Wine is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows
	  applications on Linux. Instead of simulating internal
	  Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine
	  translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly,
	  eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other
	  methods.
