## SEGA MODEL 2 IMPORTANT INFO ##
---------------------------------

You need to run a rom at least once AND be connected to the internet.
This creates the directory structure & installs the associated windows directx libraries.

Note: It may take some time before the game starts on the first use, this is normal
*** Be patient it can take up to 10 minutes! ***

------------------------
Controller configuration
------------------------

Note: Keyboard & mouse required in addition to your controller(s).

You must map your controls per rom you intend to run.
We recommend you do this using the Emulation Station F1 menu option and choose the mode2 config app.
The rom must be loaded before you can configure the controls.
Once the controls are set, they're saved for future use.

------------
Service Menu
------------

Note: Keyboard required.

If you receive the error 'Network Board Note Present'.
Go to the Service Menu using F2, use F1 to navigate to 'Games System' & press F2.
Under 'Games System', choose 'Link ID' using F1 & then use F2 to change this option to 'Single'.
Use F1 to navigate to 'Exit', hit F2 again.
Do this one more time to exit the Service Menu.

The Service Menu configuration will be saved and the error will not occur again.
