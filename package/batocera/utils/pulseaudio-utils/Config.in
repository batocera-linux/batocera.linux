	  PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes, meaning that it
	  is a proxy for your sound applications. It allows you to do
	  advanced operations on your sound data as it passes between
	  your application and your hardware. Things like transferring
	  the audio to a different machine, changing the sample format
	  or channel count and mixing several sounds into one are
	  easily achieved using a sound server.
