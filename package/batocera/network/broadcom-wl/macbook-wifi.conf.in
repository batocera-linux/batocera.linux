# Unfortunately the older `wl` broadcom driver conflicts with other drivers in the kernel.
# Therefore we need to rename this file so that other kernel modules don't conflict with it.
# Rename this so that the .disabled is removed from the name - i.e. macbook-wifi.conf
# Also rename the file blacklist-wl.conf to blacklist-wl.conf.disabled.
# Afterwards type: batocera-save-overlay
# This will make the changes permanent, then reboot.

blacklist ssb
blacklist bcma
blacklist b43
blacklist brcmsmac
