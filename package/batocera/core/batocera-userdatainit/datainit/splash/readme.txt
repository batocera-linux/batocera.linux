Place your splashscreens files here
They will be copied to /boot/splash automatically

Attention! Every data will be copied! There is no difference
between pictures, movies, music and gamesdata

If you delete some data it will be removed from /boot/splash, too
Remember if your board does not support video splashes then they won't be played!
