## The device used to store the share data a.k.a. userdata.
## INTERNAL -> Use the same drive Batocera has been flashed to. See https://wiki.batocera.org/add_games_bios on how to add files to the internal storage.
## ANYEXTERNAL -> Use the first external storage detected. See https://wiki.batocera.org/store_games_on_a_second_usb_sata_drive
## Putting the name here of the drive instead will use that specific external storage. Use the menu in Batocera to see the available options.
## DEVICES -> Use external storage for individual folders. See https://wiki.batocera.org/store_games_on_a_second_usb_sata_drive#manual_configuration_with_batocera-bootconf_advanced
## DEV -> Manually define the GUID of the storage device requested. See https://wiki.batocera.org/store_games_on_a_second_usb_sata_drive#dev_mode
## NETWORK -> Use the network share, requires configuration first. See https://wiki.batocera.org/store_games_on_a_nas
sharedevice=INTERNAL

## Add a wait time (in case the share device takes a while to come "online") in seconds.
#sharewait=15

## Automatically resize the userdata partition if unallocated space is present on the drive. Disables itself once completed successfully.
autoresize=true

### GPU's ###

## Manually override Nvidia driver selected. Leave this setting commented to have Batocera automatically select the correct driver.
## See https://wiki.batocera.org/supported_pc_hardware
## true -> Use the current production driver.
## legacy -> Use the "legacy" 470 driver (could be subject to change, though unlikely).
## legacy390 -> Use the older 390 driver.
## false -> Use the open-source Nouveau drivers.

## Note: You DO NOT need to set this unless you want to select a particular compatible driver version.
#nvidia-driver=true

## Use the amdgpu Mesa driver over the redeon driver if supported. set to false to disable this if needed.
amdgpu=true

### Hybrid Laptops ###

## By default Batocera from v38 will detect laptops with multiple GPUs and set the appropriate prime value.
## You should not need to set the prime options below unless absolutely necessary.
## Set the boolean to false to disable accordingly.

## Helps with modern laptops (post-2018) with Nvidia hybrid graphics that default to using integrated graphics.
#nvidia-prime=true

## Helps with modern laptops with AMD hybrid graphics that default to using integrated graphics
#radeon-prime=true

## Disable the splash screen.
#splash.screen.enabled=0

## Maximum or specific machine resolution (get the full list for your display with "batocera-resolution listModes")
## See https://wiki.batocera.org/display_issues#force_any_specific_supported_resolution_in_es_instead_of_the_default_maximum_one
#es.resolution=max-1920x1080
