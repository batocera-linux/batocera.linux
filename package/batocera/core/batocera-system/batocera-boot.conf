## Putting the name here of the drive instead will use that specific external storage. Use the menu in Batocera to see the available options.
## DEVICES -> Use external storage for individual folders. See https://wiki.batocera.org/store_games_on_a_second_usb_sata_drive#manual_configuration_with_batocera-bootconf_advanced
