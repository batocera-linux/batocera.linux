With this utility you can create a custom monitor if the standard ones show the image off-center.
Just follow the onscreen instructions to center grid using keyboard or gamepad, and press Enter when done.
It will reboot with the new custom monitor calculated.
You might need to adjust Emulationstation centering also (see wiki).

You only need to do a first calibration once

* Start the calibration by pressing the gun trigger.
* Follow the onscreen instructions and aim at all the 4 circles with the cross in the middle.
* Try to be as exact as possible.
* The result will not be perfect even if you aimed exactly in the middle using the GunCon2's crosshair.
* This is normal..
			  
* Exit the script and save the settings by pressing A or B</desc>
