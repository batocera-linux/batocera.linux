## The device used to store the share data a.k.a. userdata.
## INTERNAL --> Use the same drive Batocera has been flashed to. See https://wiki.batocera.org/add_games_bios on how to add files to the internal storage.
## ANYEXTERNAL --> Use the first external storage detected. See https://wiki.batocera.org/store_games_on_a_second_usb_sata_drive
## Putting the name here of the drive instead will use that specific external storage. Use the menu in Batocera to see the available options.
## DEVICES --> Use external storage for individual folders. See https://wiki.batocera.org/store_games_on_a_second_usb_sata_drive#manual_configuration_with_batocera-bootconf_advanced
## DEV --> Manually define the GUID of the storage device requested. See https://wiki.batocera.org/store_games_on_a_second_usb_sata_drive#dev_mode
## NETWORK --> Use the network share, requires configuration first. See https://wiki.batocera.org/store_games_on_a_nas

## Add a wait time (in case the share device takes a while to come "online") in seconds.
#sharewait=15

## Automatically resize the userdata partition if unallocated space is present on the drive. Disables itself once completed successfully.

## Manually override Nvidia driver selected. Leave this setting commented to have Batocera automatically select the correct driver.
## See https://wiki.batocera.org/supported_pc_hardware
## true -> Use the current production driver.
## legacy -> Use the "legacy" 470 driver (could be subject to change, though unlikely).
## legacy390 -> Use the older 390 driver.
[Nvidia_drivers]nvidia-driver=true

## Enable the Nvidia prime switcher. Helps with modern laptops (post-2018) with hybrid graphics that default to using integrated graphics.
#nvidia-prime=true

## Enable Radeon prime switcher. Helps with modern laptops with amd hybrid graphics that default to using integrated graphics
#radeon-prime=true

## Force the i965 driver for Intel GPUs. For example this can be used to override the Iris driver.
#intel-i965-driver=true

## Disable the splash screen.
#splash.screen.enabled=0

## Maximum or specific machine resolution (get the full list for your display with "batocera-resolution listModes")
