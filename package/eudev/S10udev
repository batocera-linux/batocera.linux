# udev	This is a minimal non-LSB version of a UDEV startup script.  It
#	was derived by stripping down the udev-058 LSB version for use
#	with buildroot on embedded hardware using Linux 2.6.34+ kernels.
#
#	You may need to customize this for your system's resource limits
#	(including startup time!) and administration.  For example, if
#	your early userspace has a custom initramfs or initrd you might
#	need /dev much earlier; or without hotpluggable busses (like USB,
#	PCMCIA, MMC/SD, and so on) your /dev might be static after boot.
#
#	This script assumes your system boots right into the eventual root
#	filesystem, and that init runs this udev script before any programs
#	needing more device nodes than the bare-bones set -- /dev/console,
#	/dev/zero, /dev/null -- that's needed to boot and run this script.
