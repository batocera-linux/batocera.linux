	  Erlang is a programming language used to build massively
	  scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high
	  availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking,
	  e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging.
	  Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for
	  concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

config BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG_SMP
	bool "enable SMP support"
	help
	  Erlang provides both a UP and an SMP emulator. The UP
	  emulator is always built, and this option enables
	  compilation of the SMP emulator. The choice of which
	  emulator to use is made at runtime. If you do not need SMP
	  support, turning this option off reduces compile time and
	  the size of the Erlang installation.

config BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG_MEGACO
	bool "install megaco application"
	help
	  The Megaco application is a framework for building
	  applications on top of the Megaco/H.248 protocol. It is
	  approximately 14MB in size so if you do not need it then
	  it is recommended not to enable it.
