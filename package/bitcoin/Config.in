	  Bitcoin Core is an open source project which maintains and
	  releases Bitcoin client software called “Bitcoin Core”.

	  It is a direct descendant of the original Bitcoin software
	  client released by Satoshi Nakamoto after he published the
	  famous Bitcoin whitepaper.

	  Bitcoin Core consists of both "full-node" software for fully
	  validating the blockchain as well as a bitcoin wallet. The
	  project also currently maintains related software such as
	  the cryptography library libsecp256k1 and others located at
	  GitHub.
