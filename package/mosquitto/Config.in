	  Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message
	  broker that implements the MQTT protocol versions 5.0, 3.1.1
	  and 3.1. Mosquitto is lightweight and is suitable for use on
	  all devices from low power single board computers to full
	  servers.

	  The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying
	  out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it
	  suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low
	  power sensors or mobile devices such as phones,
	  embedded computers or microcontrollers.

	  The Mosquitto project also provides a C library for
	  implementing MQTT clients, and the very popular mosquitto_pub
	  and mosquitto_sub command line MQTT clients.
